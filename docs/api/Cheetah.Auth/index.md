# Cheetah.Auth 

This space contains API documentation relating to the `Cheetah.Auth` nuget package.

It's primary purpose is to act as a common base for authenticating towards various components of the Cheetah data platform.

## I can't download Cheetah.Auth

Cheetah.Auth is not a package that is exposed on its own, instead it is built-in to both Cheetah.Kafka and Cheetah.OpenSearch.

Because of this built-in property of Cheetah.Auth, you'll be able to use some artifacts from the `Cheetah.Auth` namespaces when you have either `Cheetah.Kafka` or `Cheetah.OpenSearch` installed.
